## Description

This project includes a backend directory with the smart contracts, tests, and deploy scripts and a frontend directory with our React application.

## Architecture - Brief explanation

<img src="/diagram.png">

The core concept of our project revolves around utilizing attestations to construct an event ticketing platform. We're building atop the Ethereum Attestations Service, with our schema representing the data fields of a ticket. This means the event organizer will populate this schema with event details and the buyer's personal information. This attestation will serve as the ticket, and we'll provide a QR code for verification purposes.

In addition to this primary function, we're aiming to develop an NFT smart contract (ERC721) that will integrate seamlessly with an attestation resolver contract. Through this integration, we can automate the minting of NFTs for customers, allowing them to store these as collectibles. This adds an extra layer of value, fostering greater engagement. We're also designing a solution to regulate prices in the secondary market, as we won't allow ticket reselling. Customers will need to return their tickets to the organizer, after which a new ticket may be attested for another customer at a controlled price. To achieve this, we're designating the attestations as revocable and using the resolver contract to burn the collectible NFT when necessary.

Lastly, we're crafting a React application to emulate the end-user experienceâ€”a responsive website where users can purchase tickets for specific events
